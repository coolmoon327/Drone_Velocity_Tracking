# Brief Survay about Sim Envs



## General Comparison

> AirSim project was **archived** by Microsoft, and new machines (like my MBP with M3Max) may encounter difficulties that cannot be solved officially.

## Regarding Human-speed Tracking

|                                         | PyBullet | Gazebo | AirSim |
| --------------------------------------- | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| **Linux Server (Deploy)**               | ðŸ˜„        | ðŸ˜„      | ðŸ˜„      |
| **Macbook (Develop)**                   | ðŸ˜„        | ðŸ˜„      | ðŸ˜ˆ      |
| **Camera Images (Agent's Observation)** | ðŸ˜„        | ðŸ˜„      | ðŸ˜„      |
| **Image Fidelity**                      | ðŸ˜ˆ        | ðŸ˜“      | ðŸ˜„      |
| **Control API (Agent's Action)**        | ðŸ˜„        | ðŸ˜„      | ðŸ˜„      |
| **Env Wrapping for RL**                 | ðŸ˜„        | ðŸ˜ˆ      | ðŸ˜“      |

- When training, we just use the env without rendering. So the UI has no effect.
- All the three tools support **URDF** files, we can model objects in such forms in case trying to use another tool in the future.
